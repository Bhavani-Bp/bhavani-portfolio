# Bhavani Prakash's Portfolio Website Development

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built from scratch as a recent Computer Science graduate (2025). Below is a log of what I did to create and deploy this site.

## Development Process

### 1. Initial Setup
- Created a folder `myportfolio` on my desktop (`C:\Users\Bhavani\Desktop\myportfolio`).
- Started with a basic HTML structure for the portfolio, including sections for About, Studies, Projects, Skills, and Hobbies.

### 2. Designing the Layout
- Added CSS (`styles.css`) to style the site with a dark theme, gradients, and hover effects.
- Used the Poppins font from Google Fonts for a modern look.
- Implemented a responsive navbar with a toggle button for mobile views.

### 3. Adding Content
- Populated `index.html` with details about myself, my studies (B.Tech in CSE, 76% from BABA Institute), and certifications (Python Full Stack, Django).
- Included three projects: Waste Segregation using CNN, Hospital Management System, and Internal Chat Application, with images and descriptions.
- Added skills (e.g., Python, Django, SQL) and hobbies (technology exploration, badminton) with images.

### 4. Enhancing Functionality
- Added JavaScript (`script.js`) to handle the navbar toggle for mobile and a "Contact Me" button that opens an email client with my address (`gadisettibhavaniprakash@gmail.com`).
- Fixed the layout to move project descriptions below images and removed the sticky navbar.

### 5. Version Control with Git
- Installed Git and configured my identity:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Bhavani Prakash"
  git config --global user.email "gadisettibhavaniprakash@gmail.com"
